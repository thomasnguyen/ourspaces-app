# Status

Session handoff file. Update at the end of every session (see `AGENTS.md`).
Backward-looking history lives in `hackathon.md`.

## Now working

- Full app deployed live: https://necessary-cobra-892.convex.site (Convex
  static hosting + prod backend, all spaces seeded).
- Canvas with every widget type, drag/resize/frames, per-widget threads,
  presence cursors + gestures, polls/votes, recap, invite links.
- Note widgets now use restrained real-paper scraps with one torn bottom edge
  and a protected footer safe zone; Hall of Fame shares that real torn edge and
  adds one small pink backing scrap tucked left-of-center beneath the card.
  Drag states stay shadow-free and stickers layer above all regular widgets.
- AgentMail per-space inboxes + Firecrawl scrape action landed (`16fa04a`) —
  backend wired (`convex/agentmail.ts`, `convex/firecrawl.ts`, webhook at
  `/api/agentmail/webhook`).
- Firecrawl web-post widget is now surfaced end to end: add a web post, paste a
  URL, scrape title/summary/cover, then persist the result as a reactive canvas
  widget. Missing covers use the generated paper-collage fallback.
- Tahoe now includes the “How Convex Works” web post in both `TRIP_WIDGETS`
  and the connected dev deployment at `#/space/trip`, sized to `340×280`.
- Web-post reading sheets now use a 32%-opaque glass layer over a dedicated
  38px-blurred artwork echo; the date tab is frosted too.
- Hacker News links resolve through the story (`9a63ab7`): pasting a
  `news.ycombinator.com/item?id=…` URL hits the official HN Firebase API for the
  external article URL + points/comments, Firecrawl scrapes the article, and the
  card grows an orange “▲ points · comments” tab (top-right of cover) that opens
  the HN thread. Ask HN text posts scrape the HN page and credit the submitter.
  Scrape payload gained `discussionUrl`/`points`/`commentCount` (empty/0 for
  normal links).

## Broken / known issues

- (none recorded yet)

## Now also working

- Playlist widget is a real SomaFM room radio: play/pause, 6 stations,
  live track titles, Convex-synced station so others can tap join.
- Audio is local (browser autoplay). Pause does not stop the room for
  everyone. Streams are ice2/ice6/ice5 `*-128-mp3` from somafm.com.

## Next up

- Re-seed live Convex (`npx convex run seed:demo` or equivalent) so
  production canvases pick up the SomaFM fields and seeded buildclub/Tahoe
  web-post cards.
- Surface AgentMail in the UI (email → canvas mutations).
- Add the web-post discussion layer: OpenAI creates two direct questions, then
  answers and upvotes sync live. This satisfies the structured
  extractor/decider sponsor beat without a chatbot UI.

## Decisions

- 2026-08-28: Hackathon mode locked in — no tests ever, B/C-grade code fine,
  keep TypeScript decent, 100% vibe-coded by the human.
- 2026-08-28: Replies to the human: ≤3 bullets, no paragraphs; bold
  **(question)** tags for anything needing input.
- 2026-08-28: Agents may split `App.tsx` / `index.css` when sections get hairy;
  keep `docs/code-map.md` updated.
- 2026-08-28: Notes keep straight top/sides and concentrate the physical tear
  at the bottom; related paper widgets reuse that tear while varying their
  content and backing layers. Hall of Fame keeps its one pink backing fully
  inside the card footprint; canvas stickers use a reserved top z-layer.
- 2026-08-28: Playlist is SomaFM, not Spotify. Shared station via Convex;
  each client starts audio with a tap.
- 2026-08-28: `linkCard` is the Firecrawl demo widget; `linkShelf` stays static
  set dressing. The card uses a real page image when available and a generated
  crisp collage fallback.
- 2026-08-28: Web post is a **paper clipping, not glass** — the frosted
  reading sheet was replaced with a solid `--color-card` printout using the
  notes' torn-paper texture, masking tape, a solid dated tab, and a
  `--space-accent` source chip. Glassmorphism is banned by PRODUCT.md; don't
  reintroduce backdrop-filter here.
